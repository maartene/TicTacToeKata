# Notes

## Pomodoro 1

### Goals:

- Have a project scaffold setup âœ…
- That can build and run a Â®example single unit test pass to demonstrate that the project setup is working. (i.e. the unit test does not demonstrate any domain logic) âœ…
- Demonstrate mockup version of UI âœ… (my main concern was how to make a grid for the play area in SwiftUI. Although it doesnt look like much yet, I feel confident that I now have a setup that I can improve on).

### (Possible) goals for next pom:

- Create a model that when its state changes, displays the changes in the UI

## Pomodoro 2

### Goals:
- Have a valid board definition (size, placing and retrieving cells) ðŸ”´
- Have changes of board state reflected in the UI ðŸ”´

### (Possible) goals for next pom:
- you cannot place on an occupied cell
- Have changes of board state reflected in the UI

## Pomodoro 3

### Goals:
- you cannot place on an occupied cell âœ…
- Have changes of board state reflected in the UI âœ…

### Notes:
- To integrate with SwiftUI (Apples declerative and reactive UI framework, currently the default), requires some boilerplate code. In particular, it requires 'cells' to not be a lazy variable, meaning that if we want to prevent magic numbers, we need to define the boards width and height in static members. 

### (Possible) goals for next pom:
- Determine active player (and show in UI)
- Determine legal moves
- Implement an 'AI' that makes legal moves.

## Pomodoro 4

### Goals:
- Determine active player (and show in UI) âœ…
- Determine legal moves âœ…
- Implement an 'AI' that makes legal moves. ðŸ”´

### (Possible) goals for next pom:
- Implement an 'AI' that makes legal moves.
- Refactor placeCell into placeCellAt(row:, col:)

## Pomodoro 5

## Goals:
- Refactor placeCell into placeCellAt(row:, col:) âœ…
- Implement an 'AI' that makes legal moves. âœ…
- Autoplay in UI âœ… (in the most duct tape way possible)

## Final thoughts
- It took me 5 pomodoro's to implement all but the win condition detection;
- One code improvement I would like to make is to remove the subscript of 'board', as that one isn't used anywhere other than in the tests. This feels like a risk as I might be testing code that isn't used in production.
    - One risk of doing this is that 'out of bounds' tests become less safe (i.e. these typically become traps)
- I estimate that it will take me 3 more pomodoro's to implement win condition detection, visual feedback and restarting of the game.

This is an iOS Xcode project. Meaning it requires macOS and Xcode to build and run.

To view the code, any code editor works. And there is a great Swift plugin for VSCode, that helps with syntax highlighting and navigating the code. 

If you want to run the app, I can send you an invite to TestFlight (Apple's beta distribution system).
